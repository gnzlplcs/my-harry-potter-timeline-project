                <h4>1980</h4>
                <ul>

                        but
                        his spell rebounds. Voldemort loses most of his powers and almost his life.</li>
                    <li>November 1, late evening: Hagrid delivers baby Harry to Dumbledore, who is waiting in Privet
                        Drive

                    <li>July 31, just after midnight: Hagrid rescues Harry from the Dursleys and from the Hut on the
                        Rock.
